# Data Structures Contests in C++

This repository contains the solutions to the weekly contests from the **Data Structures** course, part of the **Systems and Informatic Engineering program** at the **National University of Colombia**, solved in C++.

## Repository Structure
Each `weekX` folder contains the files corresponding to that week's contest. The files `1.cpp`, `2.cpp`, etc., contain the solutions to the assigned problems for that week.

## How to Use This Repository
You can explore the solutions, make improvements, or follow the same approach to solve

## Acknowledgments
These solutions are part of my learning process in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms with C++. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
